## Getting started

Installation files for the latest release can be [found here](https://github.com/NELCSU/PSCleaner/releases).

The [wiki](https://github.com/NELCSU/PSCleaner/wiki) linked to this project has some basic examples for using the software.

## Development

Once you have copied the project, [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check) is a useful tool to check all the project dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

After doing that, run *npm run update-all* to ensure that Electron is configured to your system.

Once updated, run *npm run build* to create a working development copy of the software. This can be run on an ad hoc basis via **F5** in VS Code.
